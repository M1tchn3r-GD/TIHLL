TIHLL

The Impossible Hell Levels List

TIHLL (The Impossible Hell Levels List) is a community-driven list that documents and ranks theoretical, impossible, or near-impossible Geometry Dash levels. These levels are not required to be human-passable and may rely on extreme precision, unrealistic inputs, or purely hypothetical mechanics.

This list exists to preserve creativity, push theoretical limits, and archive levels that go beyond conventional difficulty lists.

Purpose

TIHLL is not a challenge list and is not meant to be beaten legitimately. Its goals are to:

Archive impossible or near-impossible hell-style levels

Categorize levels based on theoretical difficulty

Preserve historically significant or experimental creations

Separate “impossible by design” from normal extreme gameplay

If a level is meant to be beaten by humans, it probably belongs somewhere else.

What Qualifies as TIHLL

A level may be eligible for TIHLL if it meets one or more of the following:

Requires impossible or unrealistic input precision

Exceeds human reaction or consistency limits

Uses mechanics that are theoretically possible but impractical

Is explicitly designed to be impossible or symbolic

Exists primarily as a concept, experiment, or statement

Levels do not need to be verified or completed.

What Does Not Qualify

The following are not allowed on TIHLL:

Bug-abuse or broken physics-reliant levels

Levels that are clearly human-passable with practice

Joke levels with no real gameplay intent

Copies or low-effort edits with no originality

Levels created purely to exploit list rules

TIHLL prioritizes intentional design, not accidental impossibility.

List Structure

Levels on TIHLL are ranked by theoretical difficulty, not completion likelihood.

Typical factors include:

Required input density

Timing precision

Consistency requirements

Gameplay complexity

Length under impossible conditions

The list may be split into tiers, such as:

Upper TIHLL

Mid TIHLL

Lower TIHLL

Legacy / Archive

(Exact structure may evolve.)

Submissions

To submit a level, you must provide:

Level name

Creator(s)

Level ID or video showcase

Brief explanation of why it qualifies

Any relevant context or history

Submissions without sufficient explanation may be rejected.

Placement & Updates

Placements are decided by TIHLL staff/reviewers

The list is subject to change

Levels may move, be archived, or be removed over time

Reworks or updates to levels may affect placement

Disagreements are normal. Harassment isn’t.

Verification Policy

TIHLL does not require verification.

Completions do not affect placement

TAS, macros, or simulations may be referenced

Proof of impossibility is not strictly required, but encouraged

This is a theoretical list, not a leaderboard.

Community Conduct

Basic rules:

Be respectful

No harassment or spam

Criticism is fine, attacks are not

Don’t fake evidence or submissions

Break these, and you’re out. Simple.
